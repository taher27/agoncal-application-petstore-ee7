Scenario 1: Test handle method with valid NameCallback

Details:
  TestName: handleValidNameCallback
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method correctly handles a NameCallback by setting the name from the CredentialsBean.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create a mock CredentialsBean with a valid login value.
      - Create a NameCallback instance.
      - Create a Callback[] array containing the NameCallback.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that the setName method of the NameCallback was called with the correct login value from the CredentialsBean.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method correctly populates the NameCallback with the login value from the CredentialsBean. This behavior is expected as part of the authentication process.

Scenario 2: Test handle method with valid PasswordCallback

Details:
  TestName: handleValidPasswordCallback
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method correctly handles a PasswordCallback by setting the password from the CredentialsBean.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create a mock CredentialsBean with a valid password value.
      - Create a PasswordCallback instance.
      - Create a Callback[] array containing the PasswordCallback.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that the setPassword method of the PasswordCallback was called with the correct password value from the CredentialsBean.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method correctly populates the PasswordCallback with the password value from the CredentialsBean. This behavior is expected as part of the authentication process.

Scenario 3: Test handle method with unsupported callback

Details:
  TestName: handleUnsupportedCallback
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method throws an UnsupportedCallbackException when an unsupported callback type is encountered.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create a mock callback implementation that is not supported (neither NameCallback nor PasswordCallback).
      - Create a Callback[] array containing the unsupported callback.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that an UnsupportedCallbackException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method correctly throws an UnsupportedCallbackException when an unsupported callback type is encountered. This is an expected behavior to prevent unexpected scenarios and maintain proper error handling.

Scenario 4: Test handle method with multiple callbacks

Details:
  TestName: handleMultipleCallbacks
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method correctly handles an array of callbacks containing both NameCallback and PasswordCallback.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create a mock CredentialsBean with valid login and password values.
      - Create a NameCallback instance.
      - Create a PasswordCallback instance.
      - Create a Callback[] array containing both NameCallback and PasswordCallback.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that the setName method of the NameCallback was called with the correct login value from the CredentialsBean.
      - Verify that the setPassword method of the PasswordCallback was called with the correct password value from the CredentialsBean.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method correctly populates both NameCallback and PasswordCallback with the respective values from the CredentialsBean. This behavior is expected when handling multiple callbacks in a single invocation.

Scenario 5: Test handle method with null callbacks

Details:
  TestName: handleNullCallbacks
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method gracefully handles a null input for the Callback[] array.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create a null Callback[] array.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the null Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that no exceptions are thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method can handle a null input for the Callback[] array without throwing any exceptions. This behavior ensures the method is robust against null inputs and maintains consistent error handling.

Scenario 6: Test handle method with empty callbacks

Details:
  TestName: handleEmptyCallbacks
  Description: This test verifies that the handle method gracefully handles an empty Callback[] array.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create an empty Callback[] array.
    Act:
      - Invoke the handle method with the empty Callback[] array.
    Assert:
      - Verify that no exceptions are thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the handle method can handle an empty Callback[] array without throwing any exceptions. This behavior ensures the method is robust against empty inputs and maintains consistent error handling.
