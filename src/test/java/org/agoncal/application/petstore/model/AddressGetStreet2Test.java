Scenario 1: Test getStreet2() when street2 is null

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsNullWhenStreet2IsNull
  Description: This test case verifies that the getStreet2() method returns null when the street2 field is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a null value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly returns null when the street2 field is null.
    This test ensures that the method behaves correctly in the case where no value has been assigned to the street2 field.

Scenario 2: Test getStreet2() when street2 is an empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsEmptyStringWhenStreet2IsEmpty
  Description: This test case verifies that the getStreet2() method returns an empty string when the street2 field is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with an empty string as the value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly returns an empty string when the street2 field is an empty string.
    This test ensures that the method behaves correctly in the case where an empty string has been assigned to the street2 field.

Scenario 3: Test getStreet2() when street2 is a non-empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsCorrectValueWhenStreet2IsNonEmpty
  Description: This test case verifies that the getStreet2() method returns the correct value when the street2 field is a non-empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a non-empty string as the value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the expected non-empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly returns the value of the street2 field when it is a non-empty string.
    This test ensures that the method behaves correctly in the case where a valid non-empty string has been assigned to the street2 field.

Scenario 4: Test getStreet2() when street2 contains special characters

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsCorrectValueWhenStreet2ContainsSpecialChars
  Description: This test case verifies that the getStreet2() method returns the correct value when the street2 field contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a string containing special characters as the value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the expected string containing special characters.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly returns the value of the street2 field when it contains special characters.
    This test ensures that the method behaves correctly in the case where the street2 field contains non-alphanumeric characters.
