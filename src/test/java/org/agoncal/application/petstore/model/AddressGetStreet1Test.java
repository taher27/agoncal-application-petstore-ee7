```
Scenario 1: Get street1 value when it is set

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet1() method returns the correct value when street1 is set to a non-null value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the street1 field to a non-null value, e.g., "123 Main St".
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected value set in the Arrange step.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getStreet1() method correctly retrieves and returns the value of the street1 field when it is set. This test ensures the proper functioning of the getter method for the street1 field.

Scenario 2: Get street1 value when it is not set

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenNotSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet1() method returns null when street1 is not set (i.e., it has the default null value).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the street1 field.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getStreet1() method correctly returns null when the street1 field is not set. This test ensures the proper handling of the getter method for the street1 field when it has the default null value.

Scenario 3: Get street1 value when it is set to an empty string

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenSetToEmptyString
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet1() method returns an empty string when street1 is set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the street1 field to an empty string "".
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getStreet1() method correctly returns an empty string when the street1 field is set to an empty string. This test ensures the proper handling of the getter method for the street1 field when it is set to an empty string.

Scenario 4: Get street1 value when the Address instance is null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenAddressIsNull
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet1() method throws a NullPointerException when invoked on a null Address instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the Address instance to null.
    Act: Attempt to invoke the getStreet1() method on the null Address instance.
    Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getStreet1() method correctly throws a NullPointerException when invoked on a null Address instance. This test ensures the proper handling of the getter method when the instance is null, which is a common error scenario.
```

Note: The provided test scenarios cover various cases, including when the street1 field is set to a non-null value, when it is not set (null), when it is set to an empty string, and when the Address instance itself is null. These scenarios aim to thoroughly test the behavior of the getStreet1() method and ensure its correct functioning under different conditions.
