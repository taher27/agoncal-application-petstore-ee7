Scenario 1: Verify toString output for a non-null Address object

Details:
  TestName: toStringForNonNullAddress
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method produces the expected output string when all fields of the Address object are non-null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with non-null values for all fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, and country).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the actual output string with the expected string representation of the Address object.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly converts the Address object into a string representation, including all its field values. This test ensures that the method works as expected for a valid, non-null Address object, which is a common use case in the application.

Scenario 2: Verify toString output for an Address object with null fields

Details:
  TestName: toStringForAddressWithNullFields
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method handles null values for certain fields of the Address object correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with some fields set to null (e.g., street2 and state).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the actual output string with the expected string representation, which should exclude the null fields or represent them as appropriate.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles null values for certain fields of the Address object. It should either omit the null fields or represent them in a meaningful way (e.g., empty string or "null"). This test ensures that the method works as expected when dealing with incomplete or partially null Address objects, which can occur in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 3: Verify toString output for an Address object with an empty string field

Details:
  TestName: toStringForAddressWithEmptyStringField
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method handles empty string values for certain fields of the Address object correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with some fields set to empty strings (e.g., street1 and city).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the actual output string with the expected string representation, which should include the empty string fields.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles empty string values for certain fields of the Address object. It should include the empty string fields in the output string representation. This test ensures that the method works as expected when dealing with Address objects that have fields with empty string values, which can occur in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 4: Verify toString output for an Address object with a null country

Details:
  TestName: toStringForAddressWithNullCountry
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method handles a null value for the country field of the Address object correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with a null value for the country field.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the actual output string with the expected string representation, which should represent the null country appropriately.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles a null value for the country field of the Address object. It should either omit the country field or represent it as "null" or in a meaningful way. This test ensures that the method works as expected when dealing with Address objects that have a null country value, which can occur in real-world scenarios.

```

These test scenarios cover various cases for the toString method of the Address class, including non-null values, null values, empty string values, and null country values. By thoroughly testing these scenarios, you can ensure that the toString method behaves correctly and produces the expected output string representations for different combinations of field values in the Address object.
