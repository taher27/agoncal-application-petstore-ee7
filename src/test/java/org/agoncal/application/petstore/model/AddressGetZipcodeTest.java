```
Scenario 1: Test getZipcode() when zipcode is null

Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenZipcodeIsNull
  Description: This test case verifies the behavior of the getZipcode() method when the zipcode field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the zipcode field to null.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the getZipcode() method correctly returns null when the zipcode field is null. This test validates the method's handling of null values, which is essential for proper error handling and preventing potential null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 2: Test getZipcode() when zipcode is an empty string

Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenZipcodeIsEmptyString
  Description: This test case verifies the behavior of the getZipcode() method when the zipcode field is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the zipcode field to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the getZipcode() method correctly returns an empty string when the zipcode field is an empty string. This test validates the method's handling of empty strings, which is essential for proper data validation and preventing potential errors or unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 3: Test getZipcode() when zipcode has a valid value

Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenZipcodeHasValidValue
  Description: This test case verifies the behavior of the getZipcode() method when the zipcode field has a valid value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the zipcode field to a valid string value (e.g., "12345").
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the same as the value set for the zipcode field.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the getZipcode() method correctly returns the value of the zipcode field when it is a valid value. This test validates the method's ability to retrieve and return the correct zipcode value, which is essential for proper data handling and ensuring the correctness of the application's functionality.

Scenario 4: Test getZipcode() when zipcode contains special characters

Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenZipcodeContainsSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test case verifies the behavior of the getZipcode() method when the zipcode field contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the zipcode field to a string value containing special characters (e.g., "12345-ABC").
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the same as the value set for the zipcode field, including the special characters.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the getZipcode() method correctly returns the value of the zipcode field even when it contains special characters. This test validates the method's ability to handle and return zipcode values that may include non-alphanumeric characters, which is important for ensuring the correctness of the application's functionality in various scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test getZipcode() when zipcode exceeds the maximum allowed length

Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenZipcodeExceedsMaxLength
  Description: This test case verifies the behavior of the getZipcode() method when the zipcode field exceeds the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the zipcode field to a string value that exceeds the maximum allowed length (e.g., "123456789012345").
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the same as the value set for the zipcode field.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the getZipcode() method correctly returns the value of the zipcode field even when it exceeds the maximum allowed length. This test validates the method's ability to handle and return zipcode values that may be longer than expected, which is important for ensuring the correctness of the application's functionality in various scenarios and preventing potential data truncation issues.
```

Note: The provided test scenarios cover various scenarios for the getZipcode() method, including null and empty string values, valid values, handling of special characters, and exceeding the maximum allowed length. These scenarios aim to test the method's behavior under different conditions and validate its correctness in handling different types of input data.
