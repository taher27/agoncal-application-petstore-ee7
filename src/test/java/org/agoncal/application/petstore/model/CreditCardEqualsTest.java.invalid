Scenario 1: Equality when same object is compared

Details:
  TestName: equalsSameObject
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance, passing itself as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when the same object is compared against itself. This is a fundamental requirement of the equals contract, as per the Java Object documentation. The test ensures that the implementation of equals adheres to this contract.

Scenario 2: Equality when compared with null

Details:
  TestName: equalsNull
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with a null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the instance, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with a null object. According to the Java Object documentation, the equals method should return false when compared with a null reference. The test ensures that the implementation of equals adheres to this contract.

Scenario 3: Equality when compared with an object of a different class

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and an instance of another class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard instance, passing the instance of the other class as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of a different class. According to the Java Object documentation, the equals method should return false when compared with an object of a different class. The test ensures that the implementation of equals adheres to this contract.

Scenario 4: Equality when compared with an object of the same class with different field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfSameClassWithDifferentFieldValues
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class but with different field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreditCard class with different field values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class but with different field values. The equals method should return false if the objects are not considered equal based on their field values. The test ensures that the implementation of equals correctly compares the relevant fields and returns the expected result.

Scenario 5: Equality when compared with an object of the same class with identical field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfSameClassWithIdenticalFieldValues
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with identical field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreditCard class with the same field values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with identical field values. The equals method should return true if the objects are considered equal based on their field values. The test ensures that the implementation of equals correctly compares the relevant fields and returns the expected result.

Scenario 6: Equality when compared with an object of the same class with null field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfSameClassWithNullFieldValues
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with null field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreditCard class with null field values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with null field values. The equals method should consider objects with null field values as equal if all other fields are equal. The test ensures that the implementation of equals correctly compares the relevant fields and handles null values appropriately.

Scenario 7: Equality when compared with an object of the same class with a mix of null and non-null field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfSameClassWithMixOfNullAndNonNullFieldValues
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with a mix of null and non-null field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreditCard class, one with some fields set to null and others with non-null values, and the other instance with the same field values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with a mix of null and non-null field values. The equals method should consider objects as equal if all non-null fields have the same values, regardless of the null field values. The test ensures that the implementation of equals correctly compares the relevant fields, handles null values appropriately, and returns the expected result.

Scenario 8: Equality when compared with an object of the same class with empty string field values

Details:
  TestName: equalsObjectOfSameClassWithEmptyStringFieldValues
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with empty string field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreditCard class with empty string field values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly handles the case when compared with an object of the same class and with empty string field values. The equals method should consider objects with empty string field values as equal if all other fields are equal. The test ensures that the implementation of equals correctly compares the relevant fields and handles empty string values appropriately.
