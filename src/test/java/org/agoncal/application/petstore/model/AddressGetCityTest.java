```
Scenario 1: Test for valid city value

Details:
  TestName: getValidCityValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getCity() method returns the correct city value when a valid city is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a valid city value using the setCity() method.
    Act: Call the getCity() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value matches the expected valid city value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getCity() method correctly retrieves and returns the city value stored in the city field when a valid city is set. This test validates the basic functionality of the getCity() method.

Scenario 2: Test for null city value

Details:
  TestName: getNullCityValue
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getCity() method when the city value is not set (null).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a city value.
    Act: Call the getCity() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getCity() method correctly returns a null value when the city field is not set or initialized. This test checks if the method handles the null case correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for empty city value

Details:
  TestName: getEmptyCityValue
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getCity() method when an empty string is set as the city value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set an empty string as the city value using the setCity() method.
    Act: Call the getCity() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getCity() method correctly returns an empty string when an empty string is set as the city value. This test checks if the method handles empty strings correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for city value with special characters

Details:
  TestName: getCityValueWithSpecialChars
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getCity() method when the city value contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a city value containing special characters using the setCity() method.
    Act: Call the getCity() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value matches the expected city value with special characters.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getCity() method correctly retrieves and returns the city value containing special characters. This test checks if the method handles special characters in the city value correctly.

Scenario 5: Test for city value with leading/trailing whitespaces

Details:
  TestName: getCityValueWithLeadingTrailingWhitespaces
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getCity() method when the city value contains leading or trailing whitespaces.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a city value with leading or trailing whitespaces using the setCity() method.
    Act: Call the getCity() method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value matches the expected city value with leading or trailing whitespaces.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to ensure that the getCity() method correctly retrieves and returns the city value with leading or trailing whitespaces. This test checks if the method handles whitespaces in the city value correctly.
```

Note: The provided test scenarios cover various cases related to the getCity() method, including valid and invalid city values, null and empty cases, special characters, and whitespace handling. These scenarios ensure that the method behaves as expected in different situations and edge cases.
