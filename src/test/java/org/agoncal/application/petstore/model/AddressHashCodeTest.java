```
Scenario 1: Test hashCode for null fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForNullFields
  Description: This test case checks the behavior of the hashCode method when one or more fields involved in the computation are null. It ensures that the method handles null values correctly and produces a consistent hash code.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with some fields set to null (e.g., street1 = null, city = "New York", zipcode = "12345").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns a valid hash code (not 0) and that it is consistent across multiple invocations for the same object state.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code even when some fields are null. This behavior is essential for correct object equality comparisons and proper handling of null values within hash-based data structures like hash sets or hash maps.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode for equal objects

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForEqualObjects
  Description: This test case verifies that the hashCode method produces the same hash code for two distinct but logically equal Address objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with identical field values (e.g., street1 = "123 Main St", city = "New York", zipcode = "12345").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for both Address instances.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the hashCode method generates the same hash code for logically equal objects. This property is a prerequisite for the correct implementation of the equals method and is essential for the efficient and correct handling of objects in hash-based data structures.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode for different objects

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test case verifies that the hashCode method produces different hash codes for two distinct and logically different Address objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with different field values (e.g., address1: street1 = "123 Main St", city = "New York", zipcode = "12345"; address2: street1 = "456 Oak Ave", city = "Los Angeles", zipcode = "67890").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns different hash codes for the two Address instances.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for logically different objects. This property is essential for the correct implementation of the equals method and for the efficient handling of objects in hash-based data structures, where different objects should be distributed across different buckets or slots.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode for objects with different field orders

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForDifferentFieldOrders
  Description: This test case verifies that the hashCode method produces the same hash code for two Address objects with the same field values but in a different order.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with the same field values but in a different order (e.g., address1: street1 = "123 Main St", city = "New York", zipcode = "12345"; address2: street1 = "123 Main St", zipcode = "12345", city = "New York").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for both Address instances.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the hashCode method generates the same hash code for objects with the same field values, regardless of the order in which those fields are declared or initialized. This behavior is important for maintaining the consistency of hash codes across different instances of the same logical object.

Scenario 5: Test hashCode for objects with different instances of the same field type

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForDifferentFieldInstances
  Description: This test case verifies that the hashCode method produces different hash codes for two Address objects with different instances of the same field type (e.g., Country).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with different instances of the Country field (e.g., address1: country = new Country("USA"), address2: country = new Country("Canada")).
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns different hash codes for the two Address instances.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for objects with different instances of the same field type. This behavior is important for maintaining the consistency of hash codes across different logical objects, even if they share the same field types.

Scenario 6: Test hashCode for objects with and without street2

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithAndWithoutStreet2
  Description: This test case verifies that the hashCode method produces the same hash code for two Address objects, one with a non-null street2 value and the other with a null street2 value, but with all other fields being the same.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class, one with a non-null street2 value (e.g., address1: street1 = "123 Main St", street2 = "Apt 4B", city = "New York", zipcode = "12345") and the other with a null street2 value (e.g., address2: street1 = "123 Main St", street2 = null, city = "New York", zipcode = "12345").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for both Address instances.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the hashCode method generates the same hash code for objects with and without a street2 value, as long as all other fields involved in the hash code computation are the same. This behavior is important for maintaining the consistency of hash codes across different instances of the same logical object, regardless of whether an optional field like street2 is present or not.
