```
Scenario 1: Verify getCreditCardType method returns the correct credit card type

Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardTypeValid
  Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType method returns the correct CreditCardType value that was previously set using the setCreditCardType method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and set a valid CreditCardType value using the setCreditCardType method.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected CreditCardType value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves the previously set CreditCardType value.
    This test is essential to ensure the proper functionality of the CreditCard class and the accurate retrieval of credit card type information.

Scenario 2: Verify getCreditCardType method handles null credit card type

Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardTypeNullValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getCreditCardType method when the creditCardType field is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and leave the creditCardType field as null (do not set any value).
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the getCreditCardType method correctly handles the case when the creditCardType field is null and returns null as expected.
    This test is important to ensure the method's robustness and consistent behavior when dealing with null values.

Scenario 3: Verify getCreditCardType method returns the correct value after modification

Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardTypeAfterModification
  Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType method returns the correct CreditCardType value after modifying the creditCardType field using the setCreditCardType method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard class and set an initial CreditCardType value using the setCreditCardType method. Then, update the creditCardType field with a different CreditCardType value.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected updated CreditCardType value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves the updated CreditCardType value after modification through the setCreditCardType method.
    This test is crucial to ensure the proper functionality of the CreditCard class and the accurate retrieval of credit card type information after making changes.

Scenario 4: Verify getCreditCardType method for different credit card types

Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardTypeForDifferentTypes
  Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves different CreditCardType values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple instances of the CreditCard class and set different CreditCardType values using the setCreditCardType method for each instance.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType method on each CreditCard instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected CreditCardType value for each instance.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves the appropriate CreditCardType value for different credit card types.
    This test ensures the method's robustness and ability to handle various credit card types accurately.
```

Note: The provided test scenarios cover various cases, including valid input, null values, value modifications, and different credit card types. However, it's essential to ensure that the CreditCardType class and its values are appropriately defined and accessible within the testing context. Additionally, if any specific edge cases or error conditions need to be addressed, you can create additional test scenarios accordingly.
